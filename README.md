# hours

‚ú® Overview
---

`hours` is a no-frills command-line app for tracking time on tasks. It's
designed for users who want basic time tracking for their tasks/projects right
in the terminal. With a simple and minimalistic UI, almost everything in `hours`
can be achieved with one or two keypresses. It can also generate plaintext
reports and logs based on time tracked.

ü§î Motivation
---

I wanted to keep track of the time I spend on side projects and other
non-day-job activities. I also wanted to be able to generate plaintext reports
of the time tracked, so I could get a general sense of how much of my time was
being spent on what. I couldn't find a tool that precisely fit these needs, so I
decided to build one myself.

üíæ Install
---

**go**:

```sh
go install github.com/dhth/hours@latest
```

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

Open the TUI by simply running `hours`. The TUI lets you do the following:

- create/update tasks
- start/stop tracking time on a task
- add manual task log entries
- deactivate/activate a task
- view historical task log entries

Besides a TUI, `hours` also offers reports and logs based on the time tracking
you do. These can be viewed using the subcommands `report` and `log`
respectively.

### Reports

Reports show time spent on tasks in the last `n` days. These can also be
aggregated (using `-a`) to consolidate all task entries and show the cumulative
time spent on each task per day.

This subcommand accepts a `-p` flag, which can be anything in the range [1-7]
(both inclusive) to see reports for the last "n" days (including today).

```
hours report -h

Output reports based on tasks/log entries.

Usage:
  hours report [flags]

Flags:
  -a, --agg            whether to aggregate data by task in report
  -n, --num-days int   number of days to gather data for (default 3)
  -p, --plain          whether to output report without any formatting
```

```bash
hours report
# or
hours report -n=7
```

### Logs

As the name suggests, logs are just that: list of task entries you've saved
using `hours`. This subcommand accepts an argument, which can be one of the following:

- `all`:     all recent log entries (in reverse chronological order)
- `today`:   for log entries from today
- `yest`:    for log entries from yesterday
- `<date>`:  for log entries from that day
- `<range>`: for log entries from in that range

```bash
hours log today
# or
hours log 2024/06/08
# or
hours log 2024/06/08...2024/06/12
```
